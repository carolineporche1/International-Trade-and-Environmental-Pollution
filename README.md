# International-Trade-and-Environmental-Pollution

This repository contains an analysis based on the University of Gothenburg's Quality of Government (QoG) Dataset, examining global trends over the past 50 years. The study focuses on understanding the interplay between international trade, economic growth, and environmental impacts across different countries.

## Analysis Topics

The plots explore the following topics:

1. **Environmental Performance by Laws Related to Climate Change**: Analyzing how different countries' environmental performance correlates with climate-related legislation.
2. **Relationship between Global Trade and CO2 Emissions**: Investigating how increased trade volumes impact carbon dioxide emissions.
3. **GDP Data Per Country**: Visualizing the distribution of GDP across various countries over time.
4. **Relationship between Financial Trade Intensity and CO2 Emissions**: Assessing whether higher financial trade intensity is associated with increased emissions.
5. **Log-transformed Exports vs. CO2 Emissions**: Exploring the relationship between exports and emissions using a log-transformed scale for better visualization.

## Variable Definitions

- **`cname`**: Country's name
- **`year`**: Year of observation
- **`gle_pop`**: Population size
- **`gle_exp`**: Export volume (goods and services)
- **`gle_imp`**: Import volume (goods and services)
- **`gle_trade`**: Total trade volume (exports + imports)
- **`dr_eg`**: CO2 emissions (measured in metric tons per capita)
- **`fi_ftradeint`**: Financial trade intensity, indicating the extent of a country's financial trade activities relative to its economy
- **`wdi_trade`**: World Development Indicator for trade, representing trade as a percentage of GDP
